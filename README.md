<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project 

This is a machine learning project for Data ScienceTech Institute, Applied MSc in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence
Course: Python Machine Learning Labs
Project: Stroke Prediction Model

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Download the stroke_data.xlsx to your local directory

In line 21, replace FILE_PATH in 'stroke_df = pd.read_excel(FILE_PATH)' with your file path.

Other classification models to test from line 124 include:

LogisticRegression()
Svm() GaussianNB() 
RandomForestClassifier() 
DecisionTreeClassifier()

*When testing the model with user input, refer to the stroke_data.xlsx for values to input
### Prerequisites

This project is buil using python 3.8.
See requirements.text for package requirements.
